# MonsterFactory

The `MonsterFactory` is what tracks all of the custom monsters that are alive, and triggers the custom handlers applied to them when needed. This class also lets you check if an entity is a custom monster, you can get the monster to make changes, and even `markMonster` This is done automatically for you.  if you are going to create your own implementation you will need to mark your monster, so the library can still handle your custom events.
